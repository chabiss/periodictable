# periodictable
Implementing a Periodic Table app in various platforms. Currently I started with MAUI Controls and MAUI Blazor and then I'll switch to use Flutter

The goal of this project is to test custom layouts to display the periodic table of element and adapting the layout for various form factor (Desktop, Mobile, Web) so each platform is stressed on acheive an intended goal of navigating the periodic table of elements with constraint on layout and presentation.
